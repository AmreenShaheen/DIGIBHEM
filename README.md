Outcome:
This enhanced model with Random Forest provides a more accurate prediction, 
assisting both buyers and sellers in estimating car prices more reliably. 
The feature importance plot also provides insights into what factors contribute the most to the price, 
which can help users understand what characteristics to focus on when valuing or purchasing a car.
